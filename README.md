# Tesla Stocks Prediction
## Description
This project is a simple example of how to use the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library to predict the price of Tesla stocks. The model is trained using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) library and the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) website data, witch was retrieved using webscraping. The model is trained using the [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) algorithm.
The charts and graphs were generated using the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library.
## Objective
The main goal of the project is to predict the price of Tesla stocks using Deep Learning algorithms. To achieve this goal, its necessary to scrap the data from the Yahoo Finance website, clean the data and train the model using the LSTM algorithm.
## Requirements
The project was developed using Python 3.10.0 and the following libraries:
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 2.6.0
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) 2.6.0
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 1.3.3
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) 1.21.2
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 3.4.3
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) 2.26.0
### Installation
To install the libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
